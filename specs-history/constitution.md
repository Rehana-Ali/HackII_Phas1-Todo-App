# Todo App Phase 1 - Constitution

## Project Principles (Non-Negotiable Rules)

1. Spec-Driven Development Only
   No manual coding is allowed. All implementation must be generated by Claude Code only after specifications are fully written and refined.

2. Clean Code & Structure
   Strictly follow PEP 8. Use meaningful names. Separate business logic from CLI. Provide proper error handling with clear, user-friendly messages.

3. Technology Constraints
   - Python 3.13+
   - Pure Python standard library only (no external dependencies)
   - In-memory storage using a list of dictionaries
   - No data persistence across application restarts

4. Task Model
   Every task must contain exactly these fields:
   - id: integer (auto-increment starting from 1)
   - title: string (required, 1–200 characters)
   - description: string (optional, up to 1000 characters)
   - completed: boolean (default: False)

5. Console Interface Requirements
   - Display a simple numbered menu with 6 options
   - Continuous loop until user selects Exit
   - Validate all user inputs (especially IDs must be integers)
   - Handle all errors gracefully with clear messages

6. Judging & Compliance
   All specifications must be versioned in the specs-history folder. Git commit history will be reviewed to verify iterative spec refinement and zero manual coding.
